# Running the TerraFirmaGreg Server Pack

To run the Server Pack:

1. Install the ServerPack in your server of choice
    * Doing it manually or utilizing a third party website should work fine
2. Start the Server Pack
    * You can start it by running the "start_server.bat" file
    * You should be able to run it using the "BASH" command, assuming your server machine has BASH capabilities
        * ``bash start_server.bat``
    * Or just open the batch file if on a windows machine.
3. The batch file will start the server, install forge on it and then boot up your world.
