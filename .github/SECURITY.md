# Security Policy

## Scope

Keeping users safe and secure is a top priority for us.We welcome the contribution of external security researchers.

If you believe you’ve found a security or vulnerability issue in the repo we encourage you to notify us.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine if a bug is worth reporting as a security issue or a “regular” issue.
When in doubt, please do send us a report.

## How to submit a report

Security issues can be reported by sending an [email to us][contact].

The team will acknowledge your email within 48 hours. You will receive a more detailed response within 96 hours.

We will create a maintainer security advisory on GitHub to discuss internally, and when needed, invite you to the
advisory.
