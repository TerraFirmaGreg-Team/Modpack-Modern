## **TerraFirmaGreg-Modern** is a deep survival and tech modpack for Minecraft 1.20.1, seamlessly fusing together TerraFirmaCraft and GregTech.
Embark on a technological journey, starting by banging rocks together, taming an untouched wilderness into an industrial wonderland, and ending with control over the very stars.

Are you looking for a longer modpack where every step feels rewarding, and you're constantly building upon previous technologies in a way that feels seamless and natural? Do you want a modpack where every mod is carefully integrated instead of just thrown in? Do you dislike magic mods, or want to try a tech modpack that feels less "minecrafty" with its automation? Or do you just want to try out GregTech without losing years of your life? Then TerraFirmaGreg may be the modpack for you!

The heart of the modpack is a tight integration between the two namesake mods:
- **[TerraFirmaCraft]** – A total overhaul mod renowned for its immersive survival mechanics
- **[GregTech Modern]** – An expansive tech mod famous for its realistic chemistry and deep, complex progession

On top of these, other major mods help provide even more depth:
- **[Create]** and **[Greate]** – Start automating your problems away early with Create's kinetic machines, integrated seamlessly through Greate
- **[Ad Astra]** (WIP) – Grow your factory even further beyond, with new logistic and survival problems to solve
- **[Applied Energistics 2]** – Cutting-edge storage and automation systems appropriate for an advanced era

Many new mechanics, tools, and dimensions are also built completely from the ground up just for TerraFirmaGreg!

Other small mods and addons tie everything together, and an ingame book and quest system provide all the information you'll need to help you succeed.

## Development

This modpack is still a work in progress, and is constantly being updated. In its current state, the modpack is fully completable, and worlds will always be compatible with future versions. Clear instructions will be provided if you need to take any extra steps when updating.
