# Skips advancement check when you pick up or otherwise increase stack size if this change doesn't pass any advancement threshold.
# For example, dirt stack size increased from 52 to 53, but there's no advancement for getting 53 dirt in your modpack.

# When checking each item criterion, first check the count requirement and see if it was fulfilled before.
# For example, there is advancement for getting stone block, any amount. You have 52 dirt, and you pick up one more. There is
# no way you can the get stone advancement from this action, because it requires any amount of item, and you already had some.
# Another example: there is no way you can get the advancement for 64 emerald blocks if you don't have dirt and you pick up 5 dirt.
