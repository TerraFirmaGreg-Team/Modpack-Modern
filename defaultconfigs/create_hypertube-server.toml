	#How to handle entity travel permissions:
	#TAG_ONLY - Use only the 'create_hypertube:traveller_entities' tag from datapacks
	#WHITELIST - Only entities in the whitelist can travel (ignores tag)
	#BLACKLIST - All entities can travel except those in the blacklist
	#TAG_WITH_BLACKLIST - Use tag but exclude entities in the blacklist
	#Allowed Values: TAG_ONLY, WHITELIST, BLACKLIST, TAG_WITH_BLACKLIST
	entityListMode = "BLACKLIST"
	#Entities that CAN travel (only used when mode is WHITELIST).
	#Use entity registry names like 'minecraft:villager' or 'create:package'
	entityWhitelist = ["minecraft:player", "minecraft:villager", "minecraft:wandering_trader", "create:package"]
	#Entities that CANNOT travel (used in BLACKLIST and TAG_WITH_BLACKLIST modes).
	#Use entity registry names like 'minecraft:creeper' or 'minecraft:wither'
	entityBlacklist = ["minecraft:wither", "minecraft:ender_dragon"]
	#Multiplier for the speed of the tubes. Default is 1.0, which is normal speed. (THIS IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL)
