# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
### Mars
- TODO
### EV changes
- Radon, Plutonium, the Microprocessor Mainframe and Nano Circuits are now locked behind Fission tech. You shouldn't need IV-tier circuits for anything before then, please let us know if we've missed something.
- Plutonium ore has been removed from the Beneath (only affects )
- Titanium now has a more complicated refinement process! It's pretty straightforward if you just need a little of it, but it has a fully loopable recipe chain too!
- The Netherarium and Enderarium have been removed. You will be able to get all their important outputs from Mars. If you have any nether/ender air stored, distill it because those recipes will be going away soon too.
### Create changes
- Water wheels and windmills are now Greate tiered! Small water wheels are ULS (32 SU max), large water wheels and windmills are LS (128 SU max).
- Large water wheels are now more expensive to craft (and now need steel), but also generate 128 SU by themselves, so you don't need to double them up any more. All water wheels now require actual rivers to rotate at their full effectiveness. You can still use them in oceans and lakes at partial efficiency.
- Windmill Sail Frames no longer generate SU, but are cheaper to craft, only needing a single wrought iron rod per 8 frames. Windmills now also require large open spaces to work at full strength.
- Water wheels and windmills no longer work in orbit or on the moon, and water wheels no longer work in the Beneath.
- Blaze burners now only need regular steel to craft, so they are the best option if you want on-demand power generation anywhere you want. (#1889) @TreyR9
- Removed all passive sources of steam engine heating. @Pyritie
### AE2 changes
- TODO
- Programmed Circuit Card has been removed because it was incompatible with the above additions. Making several machines for different circuits is intended, however if you need to do something like make a whole assembler for a single unique recipe, let us know and we can move the circuit numbers around.
- Added the Interplanetary Wireless Card, an infinite-range, cross-dimension upgrade for your wireless terminal but costs a lot of power to transfer items. Great for if you forgot something at home, but not useful for mass logistics.
- Universal Wireless Terminal is now obtainable at EV instead of IV
### Other changes

## [0.9.1] - 18.04.2025
### Changes
- Manifest fix.

## [0.9.0] - 18.04.2025
### Warning for upgrading your world
- This is a major update that changes many things! 
- It is safest to create a new instance and copy your world across, instead of trying to update your world in-place. 
- Check that everything works before permanently changing over to the new version!
- GregTech has removed its kinetic machines, so they will disappear when upgrading. Please recycle your machines first!
- Several ores and ingots have changed. After upgrading, they will have a "REPLACE ME" texture. Put them in a crafting grid to change to the new version.
- Create mechanisms will stop working and will need to be replaced with "Greate" equivalents. This means that if you have any boilers running off of create THEY MAY EXPLODE!
- Tree tap has been replaced you will need to craft your old taps into the new ones.
- Gregicality Rocketry has been removed and will be replaced with Ad Astra soon. Please recycle whatever you can and make sure you are in the overworld.
### Changes
- Latest version of GregTech! Comes with new textures and a few new features, many bug fixes and much more stability.
- Early game overhaul! You start getting into some automation much earlier and gradually unlock more as you progress, instead of having it all dumped on you after steel.
- New dimension! The Beneath, basically a TFG-ified version of the nether. Stand on overworld bedrock for a bit to start exploring!
- Quest rewrite! The first few quest chapters have been totally remade from the ground up to be more readable, have fewer breaking dependencies, and reflect actual progression. Most of the optional but useful content has been put into its own dedicated section.
- The minimum amount of lava source blocks to be considered infinite has been increased from 1 to 2000. There's many lava lakes underground, and trains are more accessible.
- Create has changed completely with the addition of "Greate", "VintageImprovements", and "Horse Power".
- New structures have been added to the overworld. Some with loot!
- More cave supports have been added. Including stone, concrete, and steel supports. Higher tier supports can hold a larger area of blocks.

  - It changes the costs of AE2 covered, dense and smart cables so the 3:1 ratio for fluix cables is reduced to 1:1.
    - Covered cables should not be 3x the price for the same functionality.
    - The 3x cost makes it unnecessarily painful and expensive to run dense cable to where it's needed.

    - This allows AE parts like interfaces to be renamed easily and cheaply.
  - It removes the in-world transformation recipe for AE2 fluix crystals.

    - Mixer recipe duration is reduced.
    - Note that the create mixing recipe for fluix crystals still remains.

    - This means a tank can be crafted to remove NBT data stuck to it, so it can stack with other tanks again.

    - This was conflicting with the AE2 smart cable recipes.
