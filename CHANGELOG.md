## [0.11.11] - 18-12-2025
### Breaking Changes
- Rose Quartz moved namespaces, so you'll have to convert all your old rose quartz items into the new ones. You'll need to explore new chunks to find new geodes with the correct ore blocks.
- The previous silicone rubber styrene butadiene rubber belts have been changed to a different item, so please break and recycle them before updating if you're using any.
- Cleaning meal bag foil packs is now done in the chem bath instead of the ore washer. @Pyritie
- Turning honey into sugar is now done in the extractor instead of the centrifuge. @Pyritie
- Syngas crafting in the Vacuum Chamber will now output into the chamber itself instead of the Basin, so it won't get mixed up with the creosote (#2378) @Pyritie
- Cleaned up the EMI pages for small and large boilers so they aren't flooded with furniture and other things. If you were using something "non-standard" to fuel your boilers, check if they're still valid. (#2421, #2415) @thederpysockdude123 @applenper
- Clay dust is no longer electrolyzable, but now you can get infinite clay blocks from a rock breaker @Pyritie
### Changes
- Added BTX fuel, a new EV-tier gas fuel to replace nitrobenzene. (#2416) @TomPlop
- Primitive illagers will no longer endlessly respawn. Instead, now they only spawn as "structures", so once you kill them they will never return. @Pyritie
#### Hot or Not
- Added "too cold to handle" and "too light to handle" for cold things and lighter-than-air things. Uses the same mechanic as tongs. Lighter-than-air things can also be negated with something Very Heavy in your inventory, and all effects (including "too hot to handle") are negated by super tanks/chests and cells, but *not* drums or buckets. Check the `#tfg:hot_protection_equipment`, `#tfg:cold_protection_equipment`, and `#tfg:floating_protection_equipment` tags for equipment that makes you immune to these effects. The equipment also protects against pipes! @Pyritie
- GregTech hot ingots are also now properly included in the "too hot to handle" system so the same protection applies @Pyritie
- Added machine recipes for crafting tongs @Pyritie
- All baby animals and more "medium" size animals can now be picked up (#2398) @Pyritie
#### Medical Hazards
- Added visual debuff effects for all medical conditions, so you're immediately notified when carrying something hazardous instead of wondering why you have Hunger II. They don't do anything by themselves, they're just a much more visible way of checking your conditions. @Pyritie
- Early `#tfg:medicines` can now also cure medical conditions! Did you think they wouldn't come with side effects? @Pyritie
- The medicines have also been rebalanced, so some of the stronger ones come with a downside, while the weaker ones have a stronger cure effect.
- The medical condition effect that previously instantly killed you (which did not spawn a corpse) now gives you Wither III instead. @Pyritie
#### Other
- Added two more early game mechanical belts, and rubber+ belts are also now more expensive. @Pyritie @Epicificator
- Doubled the durability of all space suits @Pyritie
- Added a way to convert between vinegar and acetic acid (#2386) @Epicificator
- Added a renderer to the electric greenhouse, so now you can visually see your crops grow! @RubenVerg
- Added some distant horizons config options, for those who want to use it (#2406) @Mqrius

- Added some resource packs for TFC, disabled by default
- Lenses are now allowed on tool racks (#2434) @thederpysockdude123
- The Active Transformer multiblock is now craftable at EV, with a new texture and casings. (#2424) @BlueBoat29
- Renamed AE2 Sky Stone to Suevite @Pyritie
- Removed the shapeless crafting recipe for colored concrete powder, added an instant barrel recipe to turn it into solid concrete @Pyritie
- GregTech mining machines now replace mined ores with the correct type of cobble, instead of rhyolite or vanilla cobble @Pyritie
### Bug fixes

## [0.11.9] - 7-12-2025
### Breaking Changes
#### Beginning of the Power Update
- Syngas is now available as a ULV/LV gas fuel - can be crafted from Charcoal and Creosote in a Brewery or Vacuum Chamber.
- The Coal Liquefaction Tower is a new multiblock (craftable at MV) that you can use to make Reformate Gas. It has the same coildiscounts as the Cracker, and can be boosted with hydrogen.
- Reformate Gas is the new gas Fuel starting at MV, with better yields and recipe loops at HV.
- Many quests were updated to explain these changes.
#### Update on Fission
- The Nuclear Steam Turbine has now a baseline power production of 8192 EU/t. What this means is that you now need half as many turbines as before.
- Thorium Fuel Rods got a boost of 50% steam production, so early Mars should be a bit easier.
- Heat Exchanger can now run Radioactive Steam without Ammonium Formate. If you crave for power and don’t mind losing some materials for the Nano Circuit, this is a good deal
- Massive change for steam yield. You now produce 160x more steam, but its yield is 160x less good (so nothing changes power-wise, but now you have to deal with pipe throughput)
#### Other
- All dynamo hatches on Large Turbines now void power when they are full. Be sure to control your turbines with some redstone when your batteries are full!
- The tungsten processing line has been updated to now properly loop and balance all of its intermediates. The actual processes haven't changed, just the numbers, so you shouldn't have to change your setup much. It now also outputs a little extra oxygen instead of sodium (#2267) @SpicyNoodle5 @TomPlop
- Removed black/red/blue arc furnace dust to ingot recipes, but changed the EBF recipes to MV (#2306) @applenper @Pyritie
### Mod updates
- Added TFC Gurman, which adds even more food and drink
- Primitive Creatures has fixed its spawning of Huntmasters
- New GregTech updates, both [7.3.0](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern/releases/tag/v7.3.0-1.20.1) and [7.4.0](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech-Modern/releases/tag/v7.4.0-1.20.1). TL;DR:
    - You can use screwdrivers on drums again
    - Diluted hydrochloric acid distillation circuits have been swapped, so now it's consistent with diluted sulfuric acid
    - Large rebalancing of small and large boiler fuel. Generally speaking, small boilers are worse while large ones are better, and solid fuels are now better and liquids are worse, but if you're putting all your coke oven output into a large bronze boiler, your rates should be mostly the same as before. Blaze burner liquid fuels have been adjusted to these new values as well.
### Other Changes

### Translation updates
- Chinese (simplified) @jmecn

## [0.11.0] - 05-10-2025
- WARNING! If you're upgrading your world from 0.10 to 0.11, please read the upgrade guide [here](https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-Modern/wiki/%5BEN%5D-Upgrading-from-0.10-to-0.11). We do not recommend using Alpha versions for progression, but if you do, please make frequent backups!
### Mars
- Build an upgraded rocket and set off to Mars, a long awaited new dimension! You can get started in EV.
- We're still finishing it up, so a few things aren't done yet. Please check [our TODO list](https://github.com/TerraFirmaGreg-Team/Modpack-Modern/discussions/1744) before sending a bug report!
### EV changes
- Radon, Plutonium, the Microprocessor Mainframe and Nano Circuits are now locked behind Fission tech. You shouldn't need IV-tier circuits for anything before then, please let us know if we've missed something.
- Plutonium ore has been removed from the Beneath.
- Tungsten now has a more complicated refinement process! It's pretty straightforward if you just need a little of it, but it has a fully loopable recipe chain too!
- The Netherarium and Enderarium have been removed. You will be able to get all their important outputs from Mars. If you have any nether/ender air stored, distill it because those recipes will be going away soon too.
### Create changes
- Water wheels and windmills are now Greate tiered! Small water wheels are ULS (32 SU max), large water wheels and windmills are LS (128 SU max).
- Large water wheels are now more expensive to craft (and now need steel), but also generate 128 SU by themselves, so you don't need to double them up any more. All water wheels now require actual rivers to rotate at their full effectiveness. You can still use them in oceans and lakes at partial efficiency.
- Windmill Sail Frames no longer generate SU, but are cheaper to craft, only needing a single wrought iron rod per 8 frames. Windmills now also require large open spaces to work at full strength.
- Water wheels and windmills no longer work in orbit or on the moon, and water wheels no longer work in the Beneath.
- Blaze burners now only need regular steel to craft, so they are the best option if you want on-demand power generation anywhere you want. (#1889) @TreyR9
- Removed all passive sources of steam engine heating. @Pyritie
- Create Packagers/Jar Packagers are now significantly cheaper to craft (#1892) @airrice 
- Create Casings now need stripped logs instead of any logs @Pyritie
### AE2 changes
- Programmed Circuit Card has been removed because it was incompatible with the above additions. Making several machines for different circuits is intended, however if you need to do something like make a whole assembler for a single unique recipe, let us know and we can move the circuit numbers around.
- This is because we've moved to a new AE2 fork which comes with a [lot of new features](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1378754174983868416/1418355912095039570/image.png?ex=68e39321&is=68e241a1&hm=2846f781dbb856cee89a3f80ea3200e0e36840bb10305722b0304240ee1fe6b8&)! Shoutouts to [Cosmic Frontiers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/cosmic-frontiers) for their work on this.
- Added the Interplanetary Wireless Card, an infinite-range, cross-dimension upgrade for your wireless terminal but costs a lot of power to transfer items. Great for if you forgot something at home, but not useful for mass logistics.
- Universal Wireless Terminal is now obtainable at EV instead of IV
### Other changes
- Significantly increased durability of hiking boots, and now red steel ones have even more durability while blue steel ones increase your speed a little more (#1894) @Nashy1232

## [0.9.1] - 18.04.2025
### Changes
- Manifest fix.

## [0.9.0] - 18.04.2025
### Warning for upgrading your world
- This is a major update that changes many things! 
- It is safest to create a new instance and copy your world across, instead of trying to update your world in-place. 
- Check that everything works before permanently changing over to the new version!
- GregTech has removed its kinetic machines, so they will disappear when upgrading. Please recycle your machines first!
- Several ores and ingots have changed. After upgrading, they will have a "REPLACE ME" texture. Put them in a crafting grid to change to the new version.
- Create mechanisms will stop working and will need to be replaced with "Greate" equivalents. This means that if you have any boilers running off of create THEY MAY EXPLODE!
- Tree tap has been replaced you will need to craft your old taps into the new ones.
- Gregicality Rocketry has been removed and will be replaced with Ad Astra soon. Please recycle whatever you can and make sure you are in the overworld.
### Changes
- Latest version of GregTech! Comes with new textures and a few new features, many bug fixes and much more stability.
- Early game overhaul! You start getting into some automation much earlier and gradually unlock more as you progress, instead of having it all dumped on you after steel.
- New dimension! The Beneath, basically a TFG-ified version of the nether. Stand on overworld bedrock for a bit to start exploring!
